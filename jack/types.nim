## #     realtime function must not wait.
## #    
## #     The transport @a state will be:
## #    
## #       - ::JackTransportStopped when a new position is requested;
## #       - ::JackTransportStarting when the transport is waiting to start;
## #       - ::JackTransportRolling when the timeout has expired, and the
## #       position is now a moving target.
## #    
## #     @param state current transport state.
## #     @param pos new transport position.

## #   Prototype for the @a timebase_callback used to provide extended
## #   position information.  Its output affects all of the following
## #   process cycle.  This realtime function must not wait.
## #  
## #   This function is called immediately after process() in the same
## #   thread whenever the transport is rolling, or when any client has
## #   requested a new position in the previous cycle.  The first cycle
## #   after jack_set_timebase_callback() is also treated as a new
## #   position, or the first cycle after jack_activate() if the client
## #   had been inactive.
## #  
## #   The timebase master may not use its @a pos argument to set @a
## #   pos->frame.  To change position, use jack_transport_reposition() or
## #   jack_transport_locate().  These functions are realtime-safe, the @a
## #   timebase_callback can call them directly.
## #  
## #   @param state current transport state.
## #   @param nframes number of frames in current period.
## #   @param pos address of the position structure for the next cycle; @a
## #   pos->frame will be its frame number.  If @a new_pos is FALSE, this
## #   structure contains extended position information from the current
## #   cycle.  If TRUE, it contains whatever was set by the requester.
## #   The @a timebase_callback's task is to update the extended
## #   information here.
## #   @param new_pos TRUE (non-zero) for a newly requested @a pos, or for
